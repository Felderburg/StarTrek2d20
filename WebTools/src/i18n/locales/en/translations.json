Much of this takes place within the main Starfleet Academy campus in San Francisco on Earth, but other campuses and annexes exist across the Federation, and a cadet may spend time at any of these before they graduate.\n\nA graduate of the Academy receives a commission as a Starfleet officer, with the rank of ensign, after which they may wait several weeks, or even months, for their first assignment. Some cadets – particularly those pursuing a doctorate – choose a path that requires an additional year or two of training and study, and instead graduate at the rank of lieutenant (junior grade).\n\nYou may choose your character’s Academy track, or randomly select it.",

    "Environment.klingon.isolatedColony.name": "Isolated Colony",
    "Environment.klingon.isolatedColony.description": "You come from a colony isolated from the rest of the Empire, and from the wider Galaxy. Worlds like Boreth use this isolation as an opportunity for spirituality and contemplation, while others are settled because they present unique opportunities to perform research far from the scrutiny and politicking of the core worlds. Even in the Empire, these worlds emphasize learning and introspection.",

    "Environment.klingon.frontierColony.name": "Frontier Colony",
    "Environment.klingon.frontierColony.description": "You come from a colony located on the fringes of the Empire, either on the edge of explored space or on the border with the Federation or the Romulan Empire. Your world may even have been claimed from one of those rival powers during a conflict in previous generations. Frontier colonies tend to produce determined people, stubborn and well-prepared for the dangers their home may present, and entirely willing to fight to keep what they have settled.",

    "Environment.klingon.starshipOrStarbase.name": "Starship or Starbase",
    "Environment.klingon.starshipOrStarbase.description": "You grew up in space, travelling aboard a starship or living aboard a space station. You won’t have been raised aboard a warship, but many freighters, transports, and other civilian vessels have a tradition of family or generational crews. Those raised in space learn the ways of shipboard life as children, and many take to a spacefaring life easily as a result.",

    "Environment.klingon.anotherSpeciesWorld.name": "Another Species' World",
    "Environment.klingon.anotherSpeciesWorld.description": "You grew up amongst non-Klingons. Perhaps you were part of a Klingon enclave overseeing a conquered world, or you were raised amongst exiles, or orphaned during a battle or disaster and raised by aliens. You might have been raised in the Empire, or you may be an outsider to it. Whatever the situation, you have chosen to serve the Empire and prove that you are as Klingon as anyone born on Qo’noS, even if you may have different perspectives on Klingon culture and tradition.",

    "Environment.alternate.utopianParadise.name": "Utopian Paradise",
    "Environment.alternate.utopianParadise.description": "You were raised in an environment of peace, prosperity, and abundance. There was no war on your world, nor any poverty, homelessness, hunger, or crime. You knew of those things only from studies of history and you have never really been able to understand how a society could produce such destructive inequality. You have always had access to the resources to not merely survive, but to thrive in whatever endeavors you chose to pursue.",

    "Environment.alternate.cosmopolitan.name": "Cosmopolitan",
    "Environment.alternate.cosmopolitan.description": "You were raised in environments of trade or diplomacy, and the intermingling of different communities and cultures. The unfamiliar has always been familiar to you, and you had become familiar with dozens of cultures from distant worlds long before you were an adult. The frenetic pace of life and the basic need to revel in differences between groups and individuals have stayed with you as simple facts of existence in this big Galaxy.",

    "Environment.alternate.rigorousDiscipline.name": "Rigorous Discipline",
    "Environment.alternate.rigorousDiscipline.description": "You have always been surrounded by notions of duty and purpose, and your childhood was a strict one, aimed at preparing you to take on a specific role or to achieve a specific goal. This meant relatively little personal freedom, but it instilled within you a powerful sense of what you were capable of when pushed to succeed.",

    "Environment.alternate.ascetismAndIntrospection.name": "Ascetism and Introspection",
    "Environment.alternate.ascetismAndIntrospection.description": "Your life was a simple one, lacking in many of the luxuries that prosperous worlds take for granted. This was not because of a lack, but rather a choice – a belief amongst those you grew up with that external and material abundance can distract from self-knowledge and personal growth.",

    "Environment.alternate.struggleAndHardship.name": "Struggle and Hardship",
    "Environment.alternate.struggleAndHardship.description": "For one reason or another, your world was one with few available resources. Worlds on the frontier, as well as isolated outposts, are often places of hardship where continued survival is difficult, while other worlds struggle in the wake of natural or ecological disasters, the aftermath of war, or societal collapse that leaves basic infrastructure in ruins. Some seek out worlds such as this, where “honest toil” is held as a virtue, while others find themselves in lives of daily struggle through no choice of their own and seek to either better their world or escape it.",

    "Environment.alternate.occupationOrWar.name": "Occupation or War",
    "Environment.alternate.occupationOrWar.description": "Though the Federation’s members no longer war amongst themselves, warfare is still a part of the Galaxy. Local or planetary conflicts afflict many independent worlds, and interstellar conflicts ranging from border skirmishes to sector-spanning wars are something which all civilizations must prepare to face. Worlds ravaged by war, or even occupied by a hostile nation, are difficult places to live, often forcing people to adapt to horrific conditions and life-or-death decisions.",

    "MissionProfile.default.pathfinderAndReconaissance": "Pathfinder and Reconnaissance Operations",

    "MissionProfile.default.pathfinderAndReconaissance.description": "Long-range missions often employ the most advanced stellar cartography and astrometric facilities, allowing them to chart and navigate unknown regions of space more effectively, especially where spatial distortions make those regions difficult to navigate. These vessels are relied upon for extended exploratory missions, intelligence-gathering military operations, and risky “pathfinder” operations into the unknown.",

    "MissionProfile.default.technicalTestBed": "Technical Test-Bed",

    "MissionProfile.default.technicalTestBed.description": "The ship is equipped with numerous state-of-the-art or even prototype technologies, allowing them to be tested or studied in practical conditions so that flaws can be discovered and overcome, and that systems can be refined and improved upon. These ships are often deployed on a broad range of resource-intensive missions to provide a diverse range of conditions for equipment and technology testing.",

    "MissionProfile.default.tactical": "Tactical Operations",

    "MissionProfile.default.tactical.description": "While Starfleet is not a military, the defense of the Federation is one of Starfleet’s responsibilities, and Starfleet has been required to prepare for war on numerous occasions. Thus, many ships are equipped for peacekeeping and military actions, though the number of vessels outfitted in this manner varies depending on the politics of the day.",

    "MissionProfile.default.scientificAndSurvey": "Scientific and Survey Operations",

    "MissionProfile.default.scientificAndSurvey.description": "Starfleet’s mission of exploration and discovery means that it employs many vessels for purely scientific missions, studying unknown phenomena, or supporting ongoing research. While most Federation starships are expected to have at least some capacity for scientific endeavor, some vessels are outfitted specifically for such missions.",

    "MissionProfile.default.crisisAndEmergencyResponse": "Crisis and Emergency Response",

    "MissionProfile.default.crisisAndEmergencyResponse.description": "These vessels are equipped to respond quickly to a crisis, whatever it may be.

Such vessels also serve as hospital ships and troop transport during conflicts.",

    "MissionProfile.default.multiroleExplorer": "Multirole Explorer",

    "MissionProfile.default.multiroleExplorer.description": "Many of Starfleet’s most renowned and revered vessels have been jack-of-all-trades ships, rather than specialized for a single type of mission.

    "MissionProfile.default.battlecruiser.description": "In the mid-23rd century, the lessons of the Earth-Romulan War are still firmly in the minds of those on the core Federation worlds, and some vessels are outfitted as vessels of war in case hostilities begin with the Klingon or Romulan Empires. A similar push to develop heavy combat vessels arose during the Borg crisis and Dominion War in the 2360s and 2370s. These vessels are rare in Starfleet, and those outfitted as such rarely stray far from important starbases or the worlds they guard.",

    "MissionProfile.default.reserveFleet": "Reserve Fleet",

    "MissionProfile.default.reserveFleet.description": "These starships are often older vessels that have been withdrawn from active duty and are equipped as standby vessels in case of disasters both natural and manufactured. Some new ships are also outfitted in this manner, but are classified as “fleet support,” assisting flotillas in deployments away from the supply lines of core worlds.",

    "MissionProfile.default.civilianMerchantMarine": "Civilian Merchant Marine",

    "MissionProfile.default.civilianMerchantMarine.description": "Many decommissioned Starfleet vessels find their way into the Merchant Marines, an active reserve where starships and personnel go to continue service to the Federation in a less formal and less risky way. Merchant Marines may be called upon by Starfleet to serve as logistical vessels in times of need, and many of these starships act in the place of active service Starfleet vessels when no others are available. Most other spacefaring civilizations have similar services.",

    "MissionProfile.default.espionageIntelligence.description": "Vessels equipped for espionage are rare in active Starfleet service, but are used by member cultures within the Federation, and by other polities such as the Romulan Empire and Cardassian Union, whose intelligence agencies often employ dedicated vessels (whether or not they are legally permitted to), and in many cultures, intelligence agencies may commandeer existing vessels for their needs. These vessels are often equipped with highly sensitive monitoring devices, enhanced sensors, and stealth systems (though stopping short of actual cloaking devices for Starfleet vessels). These vessels range close to—and sometimes beyond—foreign borders. Serving on these ships is often a dangerous and thankless proposition.",

    "MissionProfile.default.flagship": "Flagship",

    "MissionProfile.default.flagship.description": "Flagships are a specialized form of command ship, with a dedicated flag bridge or strategic operations center within the vessel. These ships can act as a mobile fleet headquarters, with systems and personnel dedicated to ensuring the operations of whole fleets, or even serving as a vessel for the continuity of command should disaster strike.",

    "MissionProfile.default.logisticalQuartermaster": "Logistical/Quartermaster",

    "MissionProfile.default.logisticalQuartermaster.description": "These vessels provide the backbone of any fleet, even in the era of the replicator. Whenever vital equipment or personnel need to be moved, vessels like this are often central to ensuring that those tools and people get where they’re needed most. In Starfleet in particular, these vessels also serve as a second line of operations following the important business of first contact, providing material and infrastructure support to worlds recently contacted or who seek membership in the Federation.",

    "MissionProfile.default.patrol": "Patrol",

    "MissionProfile.default.patrol.description": "Patrol vessels are dedicated to acting as peacekeepers in regions of space where hostility is not only possible, but likely. These vessels tend to operate along borders with other polities, and act as picket vessels during fleet actions. In times of peace, patrol vessels can be assigned to survey missions, or operate patrols against pirates, smugglers, and similar dangers.",

    "Role.politicalLiaison.description2e": "You serve as a representative of a government, representing their needs and interests during the operations of the crew, and providing the crew with a means of communicating with that government in turn.

    "Role.politicalLiaison.ability2e": "You represent the official government your organization belongs to—i.e., if you are a member of the Bajoran Militia, you represent the current Bajoran government. You gain an additional Directive, which only applies to you, which reflects the political stance of the government you represent. Your gamemaster will work with you to determine the wording of this Directive.

    "Role.translator": "Translator",

    "Role.translator.description2e": "You are an expert in language and communication. While the development of the universal translator has reduced the need for translators during daily life in the 23rd and 24th centuries, there are still situations which call for experts in linguistics. Encounters with new cultures often require support from xenolinguistics experts to smooth over any problems that the universal translator has, particularly if a culture has an unusual style or method of communication. Similarly, archaeological research often requires piecing together extinct languages from evidence in ways that can’t easily be automated.",
    "Role.translator.ability2e": "When attempting to read, understand, or speak a language unfamiliar to you, you may spend 2 Momentum (Immediate) to piece together a basic understanding of that language immediately, enough to convey simple ideas. This allows social tasks to be attempted in this language, but the complication range of these tasks is increased to 18–20. Deeper study, at the gamemaster’s discretion, allows you to remove this penalty and discuss more complex ideas.",

    "Spaceframe.akira": "Akira Class",

    "Spaceframe.akira.description": "In the aftermath of the Battle of Wolf 359, Starfleet saw the need for a heavily armed and combat-capable starship that could perform patrol assignments and maintain a constant presence in a sector of space to provide support or direct action in combat assignments, but still be able to contribute to the primary goal of Starfleet in exploration and discovery. The design that the Advanced Starship Design Bureau chose for this project was one that had been first proposed in the mid-23rd century, but technological limitations prevented its proper construction until then. When updated with the latest technologies, the new U.S.S. Akira was so successful in its initial patrols that Starfleet immediately ordered the class into wide production.",

    "Spaceframe.ambassador": "Ambassador Class",

    "Spaceframe.ambassador.description": "The Starfleet Exploratory Division and the Federation Science Council began to see a steady decline in scientific returns from deep space missions by the beginning of the 24th century. Starfleet had been relying on Excelsior-class and the few Constitution-class starships still in service to continue its aims of discovery, but even with the planned refits of those spaceframes, they still required visits to logistical hubs every five years as systems wore down. Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards began to develop a new deep-space exploration cruiser that would address these concerns and allow a spaceframe to go deeper into the unknown. The Ambassador class was developed and launched in 2335, and many of the engineering techniques, design ideas, and technologies created for this starship would continue to be refined over the coming decades and become the basis for the Galaxy class.",

    "Spaceframe.archer": "Archer Class",

    "Spaceframe.archer.description": "The Archer class was designed to be a next-generation pathfinder, intended for long-range scouting missions and for pushing the boundaries of the Federation out farther and faster than any other Starfleet ship class. The class’s design team benefitted from the research gained via more than a decade’s worth of technological advances installed on Constitution, Hermes, Ptolemy, and Saladin class vessels, resulting in the Archer-class boasting some of the most advanced impulse drives and RCS thruster suites yet installed on a Starfleet vessel. The ship’s design is compact, consisting of a three-deck primary hull containing all ship systems save for the two outboard warp nacelles connected by short struts to the primary hull. Archer class vessels would continue in service until the mid-24th century when Danube-class runabouts began to take over the roles they once filled.",

    "Spaceframe.california": "California Class",

    "Spaceframe.california.description": "As the Federation rapidly spread across the Orion Spur in the 2350s, Starfleet was seeing a lack of vessels able to respond to needs of all kinds inside the borders of the polity. Starfleet opened up the possibility for member worlds to design and build their own starship class to be able to respond to issues they felt were pressing to their own colonies and interests. Earth presented the California class based on already standardized Starfleet designs, but with features that were Earth specific, and would go on to influence the Galaxy-class starships of the next decade. California-class vessels were seen as dependable workhorses, but were never built in numbers comparable to Excelsior- and Miranda-class vessels, making them rarely seen outside of Human and cetacean dominated volumes of the Federation. They continued to be used by Starfleet in front line roles until the mid-25th century when they were slowly phased into civilian use.",

    "Spaceframe.cardenas": "Cardenas Class",

    "Spaceframe.cardenas.description": "The successes seen in the other classes resulting from Operation Next Step gave the Admiralty hope that other ideas that had been proposed in the first years of the project could be expanded upon and fully realized. One such concept was a “rapid response frigate” that was the same dimensions as the earlier Next Step designs. With the Federation quickly expanding across the Orion Arm, the Cardenas-class design only went through a single revision phase, with many of the initial engineering problems being worked out as the first spaceframes were being constructed. \n\nThe Cardenas class became one of the more prestigious postings a person could gain in the early 23rd century. The speed that it was designed to utilize not only saw the vessel being dispatched to star systems along the Klingon and Romulan Neutral Zones for intercepts or chasing sensor shadows, but the vessel was also used as a high-speed explorer. As this class was highly specialized with its warp propulsion systems, refitting the spaceframe proved to be time consuming, resulting in this class spending almost double the amount of time in dry dock compared to other vessels of similar displacement. This issue compounded itself with the development of duotronic computers in the early 2240s. \n\nBy 2245 the vast majority of Cardenas-class vessels were out of active service and undergoing service or refit. The launch of the Constitution-class vessel would bring the end of these vessels, and Starfleet would allow the spaceframes currently undergoing refit to continue, but would order the rest of the vessels to be mothballed. The last active Cardenas class, U.S.S. Van Allen, retired in 2263.",

    "Spaceframe.centaur": "Centaur Class",

    "Spaceframe.centaur.description": "In the mid-2280s, Starfleet felt that the next generation of light cruisers should begin development based on the new technologies being developed in tandem for the Excelsior class. The failures of the prototype transwarp systems in the Excelsior class meant delays for the light cruiser, then named the Centaur class. Extensive redesigns of most systems were undertaken by the mid-2290s, with additional vessels of the class beyond the prototype coming into service. Externally this class resembles the Excelsior class in many regards, including sharing the same saucer for its primary hull and elongated transwarp-style nacelles. Not as modular and mission-customizable as the Miranda class, the Centaur class would only be produced in small numbers, and was seen as a specialist vessel during an age when multipurpose vessels were in ascendancy in Starfleet Command.",

    "Spaceframe.constellation": "Constellation Class",

    "Spaceframe.constellation.description": "The Constellation class was developed in the mid 2280s as both a response to increasing tension with the Klingon Empire and to the difficulties in the development of the new transwarp system for Excelsior-class vessels. The vessel was never intended as a warship of the kind used by the Empire, nor did it have as much weaponry as a fully-armed Miranda-class ship, but Constellation-class vessels were intended to be able to intercept incursions from the Empire at high warp speeds and survive until heavier reinforcements could arrive. This class’s intended use would never occur, as the Khitomer Accords were signed soon after the class’s widespread deployment. Instead of being taken out of service or redeployed, Constellation-class vessels were given different assignments, acting as first responders to crises across the Federation and the unclaimed sectors surrounding its slowly expanding borders.",

    "Spaceframe.constitution": "Constitution Class",

    "Spaceframe.constitution.description": "The symbol of Starfleet in the mid-to-late 23rd century, the Constitution class would become legendary across the Orion Spur due to its five-year missions.\n\nConstruction of the vessels was accomplished primarily in the Sol system, but after the initial block of vessels was completed and the first five-year missions were at an end, spaceframes were manufactured in other core world systems capable of handling the large spaceframe. The Constitution class would become the testbed of new technologies in the early 2270s that were developed out of the same classes’ five-year missions and lessons learned from the brief war with the Klingon Empire. The spaceframe continued in service until the mid-24th century.",

    "Spaceframe.crossfield": "Crossfield Class",

    "Spaceframe.crossfield.description": "Designed and produced in secret, the Crossfield class was produced solely to test the theoretical “displacement-activated spore hub drive” developed by Doctors Paul Stamets and Justin Straal. The launch of U.S.S. Crossfield in 2255 was a success for starship research and development for Starfleet, but initial tests of the spore drive were  unsuccessful. By early 2256, these flaws in the drive system were ironed out and the spaceframes were launched just prior to the outbreak of hostilities with the Klingon Empire.\n\nWith the limited number of spaceframes produced and the loss of both Glenn and Discovery to drive failures in 2256 and 2258 respectively, only U.S.S. Crossfield was left in service, and further spaceframes had their production canceled. Crossfield herself would continue in service with the Starfleet Corps of Engineers until a collision with a sizable piece of an asteroid rendered the vessel unsalvageable after being towed back to Spacedock in 2273. It remained there in use as a testbed for new technologies until it was finally broken up in 2290.",

    "Spaceframe.daedalus": "Daedalus Class",

    "Spaceframe.daedalus.description": "The Daedalus class served Starfleet as its primary patrol, colony support, and exploration craft prior to the introduction of the N X class. The rapidly expanding influence of United Earth meant the construction of these spaceframes had to occur at a rapid pace, meaning that these vessels were built with the lowest amount of advanced technology as  possible, as well as systems that would require little from shipyards for maintenance. The success of this class during the Earth-Romulan War, and its amazing adaptability, meant that it would continue to serve actively in Starfleet into the mid-23rd century, and in civilian support roles into the late 24th century.",

    "Spaceframe.defiant": "Defiant Class",

    "Spaceframe.defiant.description": "As Starfleet had little experience in designing a warship from the ground up, the development of the Defiant class began before the destruction of the fleet at Wolf 359 by the Borg in 2367, and wouldn’t see the construction of the first spaceframe until 2371 – and only then after delays and massive redesigns, as new technology was developed to fight the Borg.",

    "Spaceframe.engle": "Engle Class",

    "Spaceframe.engle.description": "The Engle class had gone so far as to have an experimental spaceframe constructed in 2208, and was finally finished with the advent of newer warp coil designs in 2224. Fast classes of starships such as the Cardenas class were useful, but required large amounts of material to produce, as well as significant amounts of energy to maintain a stable warp field. The Engle class was smaller, and required a much smaller warp core to maintain high velocities and a stable field.\n\nThe spaceframe proved to be popular for new member worlds of the Federation to request Starfleet to build at their shipyards due to its speed and size. During the 2230s and 40s many of the first Starfleet vessels to be assigned to a newly admitted or colonized world were Engles.\n\nEngle-class vessels were relegated to Starfleet Medical as emergency response ships and kept in active service in that role until the late 2290s.",

    "Spaceframe.excelsior": "Excelsior Class",

    "Spaceframe.excelsior.description": "What was originally intended as a testbed for the highly experimental “transwarp” propulsion system, the “Great Experiment” was seen as a disaster after the complete failure of Excelsior’s propulsion systems in 2285. After a total redesign was performed on nearly all ship’s systems, the transwarp propulsion was replaced with standard warp propulsion. The versatile Excelsior spaceframe became a standard sight across the Federation and beyond, and continues to be manufactured into the 2390s.",

    "Spaceframe.gagarin": "Gagarin Class",

    "Spaceframe.gagarin.description": "The latter decades of the 24th century were tumultuous. The difficult political climate gave rise to a faction of hawks in Starfleet who insisted that deterrence was an important tool. If new war did come, Starfleet would need starships capable of engaging new adversaries. The Gagarin-class battlecruiser is one of several designs ordered by a Starfleet shedding its isolationism and preparing to face a new century of uncertainty.",

    "Spaceframe.galaxy": "Galaxy Class",

    "Spaceframe.galaxy.description": "The Galaxy class was designed to surpass any exploration and science vessel ever developed by Starfleet, including the most advanced technologies of the 2350s. This spaceframe also represented a totally new philosophy for crew mental well-being on long duration, deep space assignments, as it saw Starfleet providing facilities and living quarters for civilian dependents and volunteers. The concept centered on not separating families from loved ones for years at a time, and the morale on Galaxy-class vessels was correspondingly high.",

    "Spaceframe.hoover": "Hoover Class",
    "Spaceframe.intrepid": "Intrepid Class",

    "Spaceframe.intrepid.description": "After a decade in service, Starfleet had seen the successes and failures of the Galaxy-class vessels then in service. As that large vessel was being used more as a diplomatic and command vessel than for exploration, Starfleet felt there was a need for a smaller and faster deep-space explorer. Containing the best technology of the early 2370s and evolved from the Nova class’s design and materials, the new Intrepid class was a symbol of the Federation Science Council’s intent to have Starfleet return to its stated goals of exploration and science. The Dominion War would reduce the number of hulls constructed, but the end of the war – and the return of U.S.S. Voyager to Federation space in 2378 – meant renewed passion for this spaceframe.",

    "Spaceframe.inquiry": "Inquiry Class",

    "Spaceframe.inquiry.description": "The technological renaissance for the Federation in the late 24th century produced giant strides forward in almost every aspect of life for its citizens, and Starfleet saw each of these as an opportunity to push its design philosophy forward. The success of the Vesta class had Starfleet attempting to build a more automated and adaptive spaceframe capable of using quantum slipstream, and to be as modular as the Nebula and Luna classes. It was determined that installing a QSD would require far too many crew members to operate, and instead focus was put upon improving the vessel’s sustained cruising velocity. The Inquiry-class exploration cruiser was the result, and began replacing Miranda-class vessels almost immediately. The first large-scale deployment of these vessels was the 1st Devron Heavy Response Squadron under the command of Captain Riker in 2399.",

    "Spaceframe.luna": "Luna Class",

    "Spaceframe.luna.description": "With the design success of the Intrepid class, Starfleet immediately began the parallel development of a heavy explorer capable of all the same exploratory and scientific assignments of an Intrepid class, but with larger research facilities, more computer processing power, and longer mission duration. The Luna class exited its design phase eight months after her sister class, and while there were engineering delays, U.S.S. Luna NX-80101 slipped her drydock over Mars in late 2372. Further delays occurred because of the outbreak of war between the Klingon Empire, and later, the Dominion. While the Luna class was approved for production, further vessels weren’t launched until 2375.",

    "Spaceframe.odyssey.description": "Following encounters with the massive starships fielded by the Borg, Dominion, and the Remans, Starfleet planners were concerned that the Federation’s heavy cruisers were falling behind the curve on defensive and offensive capability. In response, the Admiralty decided to invest in an ambitious design program. The goal was to create Starfleet’s own iteration of a massive “star cruiser” that could compete with these super-capital-class starships on a peer footing. The project would yield the U.S.S. Odyssey, the U.S.S. Verity, and eventually the next Starship Enterprise, NCC-1701-F. The Odyssey class would carry the Federation’s flag into the 25th century as a beacon of hope during a  tumultuous era.",

    "Spaceframe.parliament": "Parliament Class",
    "Spaceframe.pathfinder": "Pathfinder Class",

    "Spaceframe.pathfinder.description": "Starfleet’s order of battle has long emphasized the humble science vessel, to the point where many admiralty planners regularly complain that fleet resources are being misallocated given the recent belligerent political climate of the Galaxy. While the turn of the 25th century has certainly seen a shift in new construction away from pure research ships into cruisers and escorts, the Admiralty continues to pursue ways to build versatile starships that are useful as defense platforms but also excel at research and exploration. A sixth-generation example of Starfleet’s long-range science vessel, the Pathfinder’s namesake is the mission that helped bring the U.S.S. Voyager home 40 years ago.",

    "Spaceframe.reliant": "Reliant Class",

    "Spaceframe.reliant.description": "The Admiralty needed a replacement for the Miranda class that could serve as the backbone of Starfleet’s logistical and operational support corps. Unlike the Miranda, which began life as a long-range cruiser and transitioned to logistical and support duties as it became outclassed by newer constructions, the Reliant would be designed as a support ship from its inception. The Reliant was one of the first starship classes to fully embrace the “sixth generation” of Starfleet starship technology, featuring more automation, more versatile particle emitters and sensors, and a fast but limited quantum slipstream burst projector.",

    "Spaceframe.ross": "Ross Class",

    "Spaceframe.ross.description": "The Ross-class exploration cruiser is an evolution of the large, long-range explorer-type vessel, building on the successes of its Galaxy-class predecessor. The Ross is a product of a variety of important advancements in Starfleet’s tactical and computational systems that came about in the 2370s. The Admiralty envisioned the Ross as a complement to the Sovereign-class assault cruiser. In contrast to the Sovereign’s focus on combat performance and fleet command, the Ross used its extra tonnage to host a large suite of diplomatic quarters, crew-support facilities, science labs, and even an auxiliary warp core.",

It is a generational evolution from its Nebula-class predecessor and brings a selection of turn-of-the-century technologies to the long-range surveyor mission profile. The Sutherland design incorporates the “sixth generation” suite of starship technologies pioneered by the Reliant class into a much larger survey cruiser, with an emphasis on modernizing its defensive systems in addition to adding the latest research facilities.",

    "Species.aenar.description": "An offshoot of Andorians, the Aenar are a telepathic species whose lack of sight is compensated by their enhanced senses and telepathic abilities. Once thought to be a myth, the Aenar prefer their solitude and live in shielded communities far from their fellow Andorians. Though they are few in number, the Aenar are highly valued for their sensory capabilities. The Andorian government has granted them some degree of sovereignty to manage their own matters. While most prefer to stick to the polar icecaps of their homeworld, some Aenar have left Andoria to pursue careers in Starfleet or other efforts. Known for possessing a fascination with technology, some have gone on to become valued engineers.",
    "Species.aenar.description2e": "The Aenar are a subspecies of Andorians originally native to an isolated region of the northern wastes of Andoria. Though typically blind, they are telepathic, and their other senses are heightened. Once believed to be a myth, the Aenar are few and most prefer to remain within their isolated settlements, and they rarely bother themselves with matters outside their own communities. They lack the distinctive blue skin pigmentation of other Andorians, instead having skin tones that range from white, to ice blue, to pale gray. Aenar deplore violence, and commonly follow a strictly pacifist ideology.\n\nCompared to their Andorian kin, Aenar often seem calm and restrained. They are no less proud of their heritage, but they express that pride differently, often taking great pride in their skills and the work they do.

Their telepathic capabilities make them highly valued by other species as well, and with technological aid some are able to project their thoughts over vast distances. Some Aenar have a sardonic view of the world while others seem to be filled with endless curiosity about what they can experience outside of their communes.",
    "Species.aenar.traitDescription2e": "Biologically similar to Andorians, Aenar differ in a number of ways. Aenar are typically blind, but their other senses are heightened to a degree that more than compensates for their lack of sight.

They had green skin, flat noses, hair resembling kelp, webbed hands, and fins on their ankles. Argo was once mostly land, but planetary-wide seismic disturbances caused the land to gradually sink into the sea. Though not everyone chose the procedure, the medically advanced Aquans developed drugs to turn themselves into an aquatic species. Although they had the means to reverse the transformation, once they became water breathers, they chose to forget their past and construct a new society beneath the sea.\n\nThe reversal formula was lost to time, and the remaining air breathers were seen as enemies. Among the water-breathing Aquans’ many medical talents were the manipulation and erasure of memories, which they used on their enemies.\n\nIn 2269, the _Enterprise_ was studying Argo, unaware of any intelligent life on the planet, when a catastrophic seaquake put Kirk and Spock in peril of drowning.\n\nFortunately, they were saved by some of the Aquans and transformed into sea-breathers. With the help of the Aquans, they were able to find a way to reverse the transformation, and some younger Aquans chose to also use the drug so they could experience life on the surface of their world.\n\nToday, both groups of Aquans live in peace on Argo, and within a year of first contact, a handful of Aquans, both air and water breathers, joined Starfleet.",

    "Species.arcadian.description": "The Federation’s philosophy of bringing peace between species across the Galaxy is embraced fervently by the pacifistic Arcadians. An aquatic species, the Arcadians believe that violence desecrates the great gift of life their species has been endowed with. The Arcadians’ brains are structured so that they are capable of learning multiple tasks simultaneously and they are often able to learn foreign languages astonishingly fast. The Arcadians are able to survive outside of water for great periods of time but find doing so physically taxing. Their dedication to peace means their homeworld has been conquered several times over the years, and the rich dilithium mines and precious ores beneath their oceans make their world a tempting target by those not swayed by their pleas for peace.",
    "Species.arcadian.exampleValue": "Peace Is an Ideal Worth Dying For",
    "Species.arcadian.traitDescription": "The Arcadians have developed an advanced culture that resolves its problems through the use of applied logic. If two individuals cannot come to an agreement, they rely upon a complex legal system to settle the dispute. The Arcadians accept that violence is a sad constant in the universe but refuse to add to the problems it causes. This does not mean they will refuse to serve on Starfleet vessels; the Arcadians rationalize this by saying they will use defensive systems to protect their comrades and enjoy using the Federation’s advanced technology to assist them in exploring the quadrant.",

Resembling the centaur from Earth mythology, the Ariolo are a species who have learned to adapt to the Federation’s bipedal society. As natural athletes, they have a proud tradition of engaging in sports such as jousting and archery. Their homeworld is a verdant paradise they have maintained by moving their heavy industries and atomic plants off-world into orbital space stations. Proud supporters of the arts and medicine, Ariolo city-ships travel throughout the Federation, where they relieve the suffering of worlds dealing with epidemics and provide music and entertainment to brighten the lives of their fellow citizens.",

    "Species.ariolo.traitDescription": "The Ariolo are a species of keen intellects and possess physical traits that give them an advantage over most of their neighbors, and they possess great patience and an unwillingness to ruin the natural environment. They do not possess more advanced technology than the Vulcans or Andorians but easily possess more patience. To the Ariolo, the universe can provide unlimited riches in its own time; who are they to rush the universe? This does not mean they will sit idly by and refuse to help others, but it does mean they will proceed at their own pace.",

The occupation ended a few years ago, but the scars it left will take generations to heal. Bajor is not a member of the Federation, but many Bajorans scattered by the diaspora have found their way into Starfleet.

Though they turned the tables on their Kelpien predators to prevent their extinction, their centuries of subjugating the Kelpiens have cast them in a role just as monstrous as  those who hunted them for sustenance.

Though they are known for being mercenaries, the Betelgeusians have a strict code of honor where they will honor their contracts to the letter but refuse to engage in dishonorable cruelty. Klingons enjoy fighting Betelgeusians in battle because they represent a greater challenge than other members of the Federation.",

The Borg meld biology with technology, and a drone will have countless implants, the result of both invasive surgery and aggressive nanotechnology. As of 2371, only a single individual has ever been removed from the Borg Collective — Jean-Luc Picard, who was captured only days earlier, meaning that his implants were less extensive than those of someone assimilated years or decades before. Borg NPCs are all mixed-species characters — their original species, and their new reality as part of the Collective",

    "Species.bynar.description": "Bynars are native to the planet Bynaus, in the Beta Magellan system. Shorter than Humans, Bynars have lilac-coloured skin, enlarged skulls, and asymmetrical ears. Their defining characteristic is that the entire Bynar race is cyborgs connected to their master computer on their homeworld, allowing them to near-instantaneously share information. Bynars work and live in pairs, being genetically bonded to another for life. Pairs of Bynars communicate using complex binary code. When they do speak other languages, they alternate phrases and finishing each other’s sentences. If one of the pair dies, it’s traditional for the survivor to return to Bynaus to be paired with a new Bynar. \n\nBynar that choose not to return are seen to have rejected Bynar society and have their personal identification code removed from the computer network. The Bynars’ constant exposure to computers makes them quick to learn new operating systems and programs, and their ability to recall data and process new information makes them highly valued to organizations such as the Starfleet Corps of Engineers and the Daystrom Institute. \n\nBynars have practiced their cybernetic augmentation for centuries: as early as the 2150s they began replacing the parietal lobes of newborns with a synaptic processor. Bynar workers and security forces once employed supplementary physical augmentations, but these have become rare since Bynaus allied with the Federation. Initially, Bynars seldom traveled far from their homeworld, as the range of their network was limited. By the late 2200s, subspace  communication had improved enough that they could travel throughout much of the Federation.",
    "Species.bynar.soloDescription": "Over time their interconnection with their world’s master computer has grown to the point that their language and thought patterns have become as close to binary as is possible for organic beings. In fact, their very lives depend on this interaction with their master computer, as well as with one another. They are shorter in height than most humanoids, genderless with lilac skin and enlarged skulls, and usually operate in pairs.",
    "Species.bynar.traitDescription": "Despite their small size, Bynars are physical robust and durable. Their augmentations allow them to communicate instantaneously with their twin while in the same system, sharing all sensory input. However, they are vulnerable to electromagnetic pulses, which can disable or destroy their implants, leaving them disoriented or even disabled.",

Due to a dearth of natural resources and an economic collapse, Cardassian culture was overtaken by an oppressive authoritarian regime dominated by the military, which began a decades-long campaign of expansion, conquest, and exploitation, including the occupation of Bajor and a lengthy border conflict with the Federation. In the aftermath of the Dominion War, with the military government overthrown, the rebuilding of Cardassia was a difficult process, not least because of long-held feelings of resentment towards the Cardassians.\n\nCardassians are a creative, dedicated people, with a strong cultural fascination with intrigue. Cardassians are inclined to keep secrets, and to regard suspicion as wisdom, and the uncovering of secrets is regarded as a valuable skill.",

While they cannot become energy, a Changeling’s ability to assume other forms is limited more by skill and experience than by physical capacity: it is theorized that they transfer mass to and from subspace to change size and density. Many Changelings find themselves persecuted by “solids” for their shapeshifting ability, and often crave a sense of order and justice in the universe, with a rigid attitude at odds with their fluid forms.",

    "Species.coridanite.description": "A reptilian species hailing from a planet lush with abundant resources, the Coridanites possess one of the oldest starfaring civilizations in the Alpha Quadrant and have trade agreements going back to the first Orion republics. Though their species possesses some of the most advanced technology in the Federation, the Coridanites have struggled for the past century against other species and among themselves. Owing to a long gestation process and having suffered greatly in wars with the Tellarities and other species, the Coridanites’ low population makes their worlds ripe for plunder by more aggressive neighbors. This has led the average Coridanite to be suspicious of others, but once their loyalty is earned, it is hard to shake.",
    "Species.coridanite.exampleValue": "At Last We Can Speak for Our Own Needs",
    "Species.coridanite.traitDescription": "The Coridanites are known for three things: their technological superiority, their shrewd negotiating tactics, and their paranoia at the notion of being manipulated by outsiders. They struggle to accept outsiders’ intentions as genuine and will often commune among themselves to discuss the actions of others. The Coridanites are far from weak, and their fleet of fast and well-armed vessels has made many would-be conquerors regret their mistakes. This has given the Coridanites a sense of pride in their culture and filled them with the belief that they will persevere against all others.",

    "Species.deltan.soloDescription": "Deltans are beautiful individuals, with powerful empathic abilities and heightened sensuality.

Holograms also tend not to receive much respect or consideration from flesh- and-blood people, who may see them as tools at best or annoyances at worst. While the majority of holograms are no more sentient than a character in a holo-novel, under the right circumstances, they can become self-aware and deserve the same rights as any biological sentient life-form.

While they can survive in a Oxygen-Nitrogen atmosphere, they found it disconcertingly empty to the touch, and required a thin coating of Teflon to avoid damaging structures. The Horta diet consisted of minerals dissolved with a powerful acid secreted from glands across their bodies. This acid permits Horta to tunnel through solid rock as easily as a humanoid can swim through water. When Horta are afraid, they can lose control of their acid glands and express the powerful corrosive all around them. They also have the urge to tunnel to safety, although they can suppress this instinct when needed.",

On their underside, Horta have numerous cilia upon which they move. Horta  sensory organs can detect the chemical composition of materials around them. This permits them to tell what gases make up the surrounding air, identify species by the chemical composition of their blood, and sense veins of ore. They have poor eyesight but can partially see in the infrared spectrum. Their method of hearing involves detecting atmospheric vibrations, and they have a highly developed sense of smell that is their primary means of communication. To communicate with humanoids Horta are fitted with specialized universal translators and vocalizers, but they can also communicate by etching text into surfaces. Horta can survive exposure to the vacuum of space, though the shock results in a temporary coma.",

    "Species.human.description": "Originating on the planet Earth in the Sol system, Humans are a resilient, diverse, and adaptable species, who developed from fractious, warring nations on the brink of mutual annihilation to a united, peaceful society in less than a century, and managed to forge alliances between former enemies within a century of achieving interstellar space flight. Earth is a founder and pivotal member of the United Federation of Planets, and many of the Federation’s institutions can be found on Earth. Humans often exhibit a dichotomy in their nature — being both driven to strong emotion and careful reason — and while they have largely grown beyond their warlike and divisive past, their drive and capacity for aggression are as much a part of their success as their curiosity and analytical minds.",

A century after that, humanity had established itself as part of an interplane- tary alliance, the United Federation of Planets, bringing former rivals together as allies. Humans often exhibit a dichotomy in their nature—sometimes strongly emo- tional and passionate like Klingons or Andorians, yet at others highly analytical and rational like Tellarites or Vulcans—which has allowed them to grow beyond their warlike and fractious past, but their capacity for ambition and aggression are as much a part of their success as their curiosity and analytical minds.\n\nHumans tend to draw upon two sets of cultural values. As a central and founding member of the Federation, the traditions and ideals of the Federation (or even those of Starfleet) are often regarded as synonymous with “Human culture” (though the Federation draws a lot from each of its members), to the point where nobody is entirely sure where Earth ends and the Federation begins.

The influence of Orion traders and the Orion Syndicate can be felt across the Alpha and Beta Quadrants, often in ways that flout the laws of other cultures, and often employing agents of other species.\n\nOrion culture appears to be divided along gender lines, and there is evidence to suggest they have a broadly matriarchal culture, with the women serving in leadership roles, while Orion males more often serving as muscle, laborers, and minor operatives, though this has shifted somewhat over the centuries. This appears to be due to a trait of some Orion females, who have been observed to produce pheromones that can make male Orions (and males of some other species, including Humans) compliant.

They are, in some way, like Trill symbionts, with colony members taking the knowledge of former colonies with them when they form new unity.\n\nThe concept of individuality holds an idiosyncratic meaning for a Pandronian. In language, this is expressed by using “this one” instead of “I.” Many Pandronians see single-entity beings as inferior and may appear cold and arrogant, but while disagreeable, they are not dangerous, abhorring violence and finding it a moral failing. Even in self-defense, they would rather ‘disassemble unity’ than fight.\n\nOutside of Pandronian cities is a vast jungle of constantly changing colony creatures, some quite dangerous. Consequently, Pandronians don’t travel at night or go far from home. This is so deeply ingrained it follows a Pandronian off-planet.",

Their bodies consist of a series of furry, vine-like extensions that are bunched near the bottom and equipped with four leg-like projections for movement.\n\nCommunication is accomplished with the help of a device called a voder which interprets the low- frequency sound waves their veins make. They can communicate with other Phylosians without the voder and at great distances when on the ground.\n\nPhylosians can be long-lived and, like the great redwood trees of Earth, can grow very tall (up to 8 meters or more). However, if living in a confined area, such as a starship, that growth is stunted.\n\nAll of Phylos has been greatly influenced by Stavos Keniclius, a 21st-century Augment who inadvertently triggered a staphylococcus plague when he arrived on the planet, significantly damaging the planet’s ecosystem and nearly annihilating the Phylosian civilization. Despite that tragedy, they remained peaceful.\n\nAs of 2270, a few Phylosians had already joined Starfleet as experts in exobotany and medicine.",

A culture of military discipline seems to keep their worst members directed towards useful ends, though paranoia and self-interest motivate Romulan politics as much as a desire for collective benefit; at times, it seems that the only things keeping the Romulan Star Empire together are the fact that they despise other species more than they despise one another.",
    "Species.romulan.description2e": "A divergent offshoot of the Vulcan species, Romulans fled their original homeworld millennia ago. These Vulcans, “those who marched beneath the Raptor’s wings,” refused to accept the teachings of Surak, and thus did not embrace logic or stoicism, and eventually their ships would reach the worlds known as Romulus and Remus. Much of what is known about the Romulans has been pieced together from secondary and tertiary sources, as the Romulans themselves are secretive bordering on paranoia and do not disclose any information about themselves unless they deem it vital. Indeed, the Federation didn’t even know what Romulans looked like until a century after the Earth-Romulan War.\n\nTo the Romulans, trust is something to be placed in only a few, for misplaced trust can be a deadly weapon. A Romulan trusts only their closest family members, and places increasing layers of secrecy, obfuscation, and misdirection as relationships grow more distant. There are exceptions to this, such as the scrupulously candid order _Qowat Milat_, but most Romulans are highly guarded and suspicious of everyone.",

Vorta are cloned, in batches of identical beings, with a new clone being activated and placed into service upon the death of a predecessor, receiving the memories of those that came before them, though each clone is nevertheless a distinct individual.

    "Species.vulcan.aboutNames": "Vulcans have only a single name, in practical terms — while they do have family names, these are not discussed amongst other species — and tend to be traditional in the names they use. Male Vulcans often — though far from always — are given names beginning with S, while female names frequently begin with T. These are far from universal, however.",
    "Species.vulcan.description": "The Vulcans are a stoic, rational people. Widely claimed to be emotionless, in truth the Vulcans feel deeply and intensely, to their own detriment. Their stoicism comes from a culture of logic and self- discipline, where emotions are analyzed and dissected to rob them of their potency, so that they cannot overwhelm or control the individual. Vulcans embrace science and reason, but their lives are not purely devoted to logic: they also have a deeply philosophical side, with art and music as vital to their culture as logic. They are also an intensely private people, with many aspects of their culture — such as the rites of pon farr — which are not discussed amongst outsiders.",
    "Species.vulcan.description2e": "The first species to contact Humans, Vulcans are stoic, rational people. Widely claimed to be emotionless, Vulcans in fact feel emotions deeply and intensely, to their own detriment. Ancient Vulcans were prone to murderous rage and fits of paranoia, and nearly destroyed themselves millennia ago, before Surak taught logic and the purging of emotion. His teachings led to peace among the Vulcans and the establishment of a culture driven by reason.\n\nVulcans embrace science and logic, but their lives are not purely devoted to such things: they have a deeply philosophical and spiritual side, with art and music as vital to their culture as logic.

    "Species.vulcan.traitDescription": "Due to the harsh, arid, high-gravity world they come from, Vulcans are naturally resistant to extreme heat and dehydration; they are also extremely strong, with keen auditory and olfactory senses. They are also telepathic, though this takes training to properly manifest, and they learn mental discipline and emotional control from childhood. However, this control takes regular meditation to maintain, and their controlled nature and desire for privacy can distance them from others, and make interactions awkward.",
    "Species.vulcan.traitDescription2e": "Vulcans have a naturally high tolerance for extremes of heat, are resistant to dehydration, and can shield their eyes from blinding light with a set of secondary eyelids. Their auditory and olfactory senses are extremely keen, and the gravity of their homeworld means an average Vulcan is about three times as strong as a Human of similar size and weight. Vulcans are innately telepathic, and through extensive training since childhood, Vulcan minds can suppress their emotional responses, and even exert influence upon biological pro- cesses, though this takes regular meditation to maintain.",

Most established operatives are handlers and analysts, gathering information from a variety of sources and establishing their own networks of informants, who live ordinary lives and only occasionally pass on information. When Starfleet Intelligence needs to perform more significant actions, it often selects personnel from elsewhere in Starfleet to carry out the work. \n\nMany starbases and a few starships have an Intelligence officer on board, who serve as a point of contact for their commanding officers and spend much of their time gathering and summarizing information that may be of use to ongoing missions.\n\nOther civilizations in the Galaxy have comparable intelligence agencies, such as the Romulan Tal Shiar or the Cardassian Obsidian Order, both of which are infamous examples feared both within and beyond those civilizations.",
