                    <p>
                        <strong>Is this a copy of the official Modiphius app?</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The app has never been an "official" Modiphius app. It was originally created by Christoffer with the blessing
                        of Modiphius. It has always been a tool that the community has provided.
                    </p>

                    <p className="mt-5">
                        <strong>Why did the URL change?</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I now host the application on my domain because I have access to deploy the app there.
                        I don't really know who owns the modiphiusapps.co.uk website, and the process by which code gets put there
                        has always been a mystery to me. There was a period where my code updates were being merged into the
                        main branch, but nobody was deploying those updates. And players were hungry for the Klingon character
                        support. Eventually I just took matters into my own hands.

                    <p>
                        At the high level, the following stuff has been added:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Support for the Klingon Core book has been added.</li>
                        <li>Support for the Player's Guide &mdash; including new character types, talents, roles and lifepath options &mdash; has been added.</li>
                        <li>Additional source books have added new species and talents, including the Discovery Campaign book, the Shackleton Expanse book and more</li>
                        <li>The app can now create a space sector, using rules from the Shackleton Expanse book.</li>
                        <li>You can view characters and starships using a bookmarkable URL, so that you can come back to the character later.</li>
                        <li>Support for a number of different types of character and starship sheets, including some that display the Talent text and
                            starship sheets that show a visual representation of well-known ship classes.
                        </li>
                        <li>Initial work to support national languages (including French, Spanish and German)</li>
                        <li>The app can generate random NPCs.</li>
                        <li>When viewing a particular character or starship, you can export the character in a format recognized by Fantasy Grounds or Foundry VTT.</li>
                        <li>The app includes a token generator, which allows you to create a likeness for your character and export it for use in,
                            for example, your favourite Virtual Table Top.</li>

                        <li className="my-3 text-white" style={{ fontSize: "1.125rem"}}>First, Modiphius prefers to wait a bit between the time a new book is available for

                            Personally, I think that's entirely reasonable.</li>

                        <li className="my-3 text-white" style={{ fontSize: "1.125rem"}}>Second, adding stuff to the generator takes work, and I do it as time allows.
